# Plasti
Template for creating a face mask made out of plastic sheets (folders/pet bottles/acetate sheets) with exchangeable filters.

The filters can be cut out of actual masks, making it possible to use them up to 6 times instead of a single use. Other, less recommended materials, can also be used, such as coffee filters or paper towels. 

Plasti can be cut by hand or making use of lasercut machines.

I am here making the .pdf for priting available, and also the .dwg files for editing the project or using machines.

Please be aware that the width of the mask at its widest points should be around 16.5-18cm (6.45-7in), printing it smaller or larger can also be done, if you find that it would fit you better. 

Plasti is meant to be an alternative to homemade masks. It's not meant for professional environments.
